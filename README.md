<h3>The Role of PTFE Tapes in Fire and Safety Applications</h3>
PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene) tapes are indispensable in fire protection systems. These tapes are used to seal threaded pipe joints, ensuring leak-free connections that can withstand high temperatures, pressure, and exposure to chemicals. In fire suppression systems, even a minor leak can result in catastrophic failure. That’s why quality PTFE tape is a non-negotiable safety requirement. From sprinkler pipes to fire extinguisher gas lines, reliable thread sealing ensures the entire system functions without compromise.<br>
